    <p>Conchas, the crown jewel of Mexican pan dulce, are a heavenly treat that blends 
        pillowy-soft, buttery bread with a delicate, crumbly topping of sugar, butter, and flour. 
        Their signature shell-like pattern—etched into a golden, slightly crisp crust—gives way to a fluffy, 
        cloud-like interior that melts in your mouth. Whether enjoyed fresh from the oven, dunked into a 
        steaming cup of coffee, or paired with a glass of warm milk, each bite delivers a perfect balance of 
        sweetness and comforting richness. With flavors ranging from classic vanilla and chocolate to fragrant cinnamon 
        and even vibrant strawberry, Conchas are a delightful indulgence that awaken the senses and satisfy the soul.</p>

            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>⅜ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>TOpping:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>To make the bread: Stir warm water and yeast together in a large bowl; let stand 
                until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in 2 cups flour, milk, sugar, melted butter, egg, and salt until combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually mix in remaining 2 cups flour and cinnamon until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to
                8 minutes. Place in a large greased bowl; turn dough to coat.</li>
            <li>Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the topping: Beat sugar and butter in a medium
                bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour until a thick paste forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer 1/2 of the paste to a separate bowl. Mix cinnamon 
                into one half and vanilla into the other half.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape into balls and
                place 3 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Divide each bowl of topping into 6 balls; pat flat. Place circles of topping on top of
                dough balls, patting down lightly. Use a knife to cut grooves in the topping like a seashell.</li>
            <li>Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
