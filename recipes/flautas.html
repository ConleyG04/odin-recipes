    <p>Golden, crispy, and irresistibly deliciousâ€”flautas are a Mexican delight
        that will have your taste buds dancing. These tightly rolled tortillas,
        usually filled with tender shredded chicken, savory beef, or creamy cheese,
        are fried to a perfect crunch, creating a satisfying contrast between
        the crispy exterior and the juicy, flavorful filling inside.</p>
    <p>Served piping hot, flautas are often topped with cool, velvety sour cream,
        rich guacamole, and a drizzle of zesty salsa, adding layers of freshness
        and spice to every bite. A sprinkle of crumbled queso fresco and a side
        of crisp shredded lettuce complete this mouthwatering dish, making each
        bite an explosion of textures and flavors. Whether enjoyed as a snack, appetizer,
        or main course, flautas are pure, crispy perfectionâ€”impossible to resist! ðŸŒ®ðŸ”¥</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Â½ green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>Â½ onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package corn tortillas (such as OrtegaÂ®)</li>
            <li>Â½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            <li>24 toothpicks</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the
                bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned
                translucent, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and stir in the
                chicken breast. Cook and stir until the chicken breast is no longer pink in
                the center, about 10 minutes. Shred the chicken using two forks. Stir in the
                taco seasoning and water. Simmer until the liquid has evaporated, stirring
                occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in the Cheddar cheese, then remove from 
                heat, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly brush each corn tortilla will a layer of salsa. Spread about 2 tablespoons 
                of the chicken mixture in a line along the bottom edge of the tortilla. Tightly 
                roll the tortilla into a cylinder, and secure the ends with one or two toothpicks. 
                Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 cups vegetable oil in a large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry the flautas in the preheated oil, no more than 4 at a time, until golden and 
                crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain the flautas on a paper towel-lined plate. Discard 
                toothpicks and top finished flautas with remaining salsa.</li>
        </ol>
